I am a PhD candidate at the [Economics Department at Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html){target="_blank"} and at the [French National Research Institute for Agrigulture, Food and Environment (INRAE)](https://www.inrae.fr/en/about-us){target="_blank"}.

My specialty is employing quasi-experimental methods to answer policy-relevant questions primarily in the areas of health and environmental economics.  
My work focuses on the effects of major life-cycle events and exposure to adverse environmental conditions on health and health-related outcomes.  Most recently, I explore the impact of exposure to air pollution on health and health care costs in France.
