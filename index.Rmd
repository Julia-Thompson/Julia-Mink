I am the Argelander Professor of Environmental Economics, Sustainability and Inequality (Tenure Track Assistant Professor) at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/){target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE)](https://www.inrae.fr/en/about-us){target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in Economics from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html){target="_blank"}.

I am an empirical economist specialising in quasi-experimental methods and the use of large spatio-temporal administrative and survey data. My research lies in health and environmental economics—particularly their intersection—and aims to quantify the societal costs of pollution and climate change and how these costs are distributed across populations.

Current projects quantify: (i) the healthcare costs of short-term and cumulative exposure to ambient air pollution in France; (ii) the health effects of residential exposure to agricultural pesticides in utero and during early childhood in France; (iii) the role of healthcare access in buffering climate-shock–induced undernutrition among children in sub-Saharan Africa; and (iv) the medium- and long-run socioeconomic impacts of the 2021 Ahr Valley flood in Germany. A unifying theme is the analysis of inequalities in exposure, vulnerability and resilience.
