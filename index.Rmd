I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE)](https://www.inrae.fr/en/about-us){target="_blank"}.
This fall, I will join the Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Bonn as Argelander Professor for Environmental Economics, Sustainability and Inequality (W1, tenure track).


I am an applied economist specialised in the implementation of quasi-experimental methods and the exploitation of large spatio-temporal data sets. My research interests lie in the fields of health and environmental economics, and particularly at the intersection of the two. I am interested in how the experience of major life events and the exposure to adverse environmental conditions affect health and health-related outcomes.

I have studied the effects of divorce and retirement on household economic resources and diet, I have looked at the consequences of early-life exposure to war on adult health, and, more recently, I am investigating the effects of exposure to air pollution on health care use and costs. As a postdoctoral researcher at INRAE, I started a project on the effects of in-utero exposure to pesticides on health at birth and during early childhood.
