I am the Argelander Professor of Environmental Economics, Sustainability and Inequality (Tenure Track Assistant Professor) at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/){target="_blank"}. Prior to this, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE)](https://www.inrae.fr/en/about-us){target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in Economics from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html){target="_blank"}. 

I am an empirical economist specialised in the implementation of quasi-experimental methods and the exploitation of large spatio-temporal data sets. My research interests lie in the fields of health and environmental economics, and particularly at the intersection of the two. 

My aim is to provide information relevant to environmental and climate policy by quantifying the societal costs of pollution and climate change. Of particular interest to me is the study of inequalities in this context.

I am currently estimating the health costs of acute exposure to air pollution for the French health system and have just started a project on the health effects of in-utero exposure to pesticides at birth and during early childhood.
