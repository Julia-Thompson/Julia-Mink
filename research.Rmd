The general topic of my research is the causal analysis of the effects of life-cycle events on food consumption behaviour and health. My thesis is structured around three articles, each article considering one specific life-cycle event. So far, I have mainly investigated the impacts of retirement and early childhood shocks in France and I just started to investigate the effects of couple separation. My work is empirical and can be situated in the fields of food, health and family economics, microeconomics and consumer demand and the economics of human capital accumulation.

Knowledge about the impact of major life-cycle events on food consumption and health constitutes an important component in the design of public policies addressing overall population health through diet quality. Investigating retirement is particularly relevant in the context of the current aging of the population. The proportion of individuals aged 60 years or older in Europe is projected to increase to 35% by 2050. It has been shown that an adequate nutrition is important to avoid or postpone the onset of certain dietrelated chronic diseases and cognitive decline or conditions such as frailty in older individuals. Policies which improve nutrition and thereby avoid or postpone the onset of chronic diseases and care-dependency may not only increase the well-being of the concerned elderly individuals but they may also help to curb the costs of health service systems which are already under strain. A correct measure of how retirement impacts food consumption and health is useful to orient policy makers in the design and correct targeting of such preventive health policies. The choice of examining couple separation is similarly motivated by the important increase in separations and single-parent families. In France, the share of cohabiting couples who broke their first union before eight years of life together more than doubled from 12% for unions formed between 1970 and 1978 to 29% for those formed between 1997 and 2005. Food consumption is one important vector of family well-being and knowledge about the eects of separation on family food consumption is particularly interesting to policy makers who want to support vulnerable families through improvements in their diet quality. Well targeted policy supporting vulnerable families is likely to avoid costly negative outcomes in future but necessitates information on how and when precisely the family's needs are aected. Finally, malnutrition and poor living conditions inutero and during early childhood seem to be important factors in explaining adult health. In the context of the current epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases, knowing more about the impact of early child nutrition on adult health outcomes offers insights into prevention, diagnosis and intervention.
