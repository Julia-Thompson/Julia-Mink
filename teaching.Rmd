### Introduction to Economics
I have been instructor for two classes of first-year students in Micro- and Macroeconomics at Sciences Po in Reims during the autumn semester of 2017 and another class at Sciences Po in Paris during autumn 2018. This class is based on [CORE Economics](http://www.core-econ.org/), an open access e-book that I highly recommend. The syllabus of the class can be found [here](Syllabus2017_EN.pdf).

I am used to teach in English and French. Teaching introduction to economics is a real pleasure to me as it was such a class that sparked my own enthusiasm for economics back in 2010.
