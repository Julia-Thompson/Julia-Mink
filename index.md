I am a PhD candidate at the [Sciences Po Department of Economics](http://econ.sciences-po.fr/) and the [French National Institute for Research in Agriculture (INRA)](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inra.fr/aliss). I currently work on the causal analysis of the effects of life-cycle events on food consumption behaviour and health. So far, I have mainly investigated the impacts of retirement and early childhood shocks in France and I just started to investigate the effects of couple separation. My work is empirical and can be situated in the fields of food, health and family economics, microeconomics and consumer demand and the economics of human capital accumulation.

I am in the second year of PhD studies and expect to graduate in 2020. After the PhD, I would like to continue teaching and research, probably expanding my work from food related health issues to more general topics in the field of health economics. Passionate about languages and different cultures, I lived several times abroad and would love to engage in an international career. I think that moving around a lot is a very efficient way to get inspiration and meet and exchange with brilliant people. 

When I am not doing research or teaching, I love to dive, climb and go for a run.
