### Welcome to my webpage.

I am a PhD candidate at the [Sciences Po Department of Economics](http://econ.sciences-po.fr/) and the [French National Institute for Research in Agriculture (INRA)](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inra.fr/aliss) in the research unit food and social sciences.

The general topic of my research is the causal analysis of the effects of life-cycle events on food consumption behaviour and health.

I expect to graduate in 2020.
