<h4><strong>The Healthcare Costs of Air Pollution in
France</strong></h4>
<p>I estimate the causal impact of short-term exposure to nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM) on
healthcare costs in France. I construct a large-scale dataset by linking
administrative healthcare expenditures for a nationally representative
sample with high-resolution air pollution and meteorological data. To
address endogeneity concerns related to economic activity, I implement
an instrumental variable (IV) strategy that exploits weekly variations
in altitude atmospheric conditions including thermal inversions, wind
speed, and the height of the planetary boundary layer. My findings
reveal that air pollution, even at concentrations below current European
air quality standards, imposes annual healthcare costs that exceed
earlier estimates by a factor of ten. Heterogeneity analyses show that
pollution affects multiple medical specialties, including cardiology,
pulmonology, and ophthalmology, while placebo specialties, such as
trauma surgery, exhibit no significant effects. Contrary to prior work
focusing on children and the elderly, I find that adverse health
outcomes extend across all age groups, demonstrating broader population
vulnerability. Moreover, marginal effects prove larger at lower
pollution levels, implying a concave dose-response function that
underscores the potential for substantial cost savings from even modest
pollution abatement in relatively clean areas. These results suggest
that earlier cost-benefit analyses likely undervalue the societal gains
from stricter environmental regulation.</p>

<h4><strong>Broken homes and empty pantries: The impact of partnership
dissolution on household economic resources</strong></h4>
<p>This study sheds new light on the impact of couple separation on
household living standards by considering the effects of separation on
measures reflecting the adequacy of food consumption in addition to more
commonly studied income and expenditure measures. Using an event study
approach with panel data from France, I examine changes in household
disposable income, food expenditure and food quantities purchased, diet
quality and household member’s body weight at the time of separation and
up to eight years later, compared to a control group of households that
did not separate. Disposable income, food expenditure and quantities
purchased adjusted for household size fall by around 20%-25% after
separation and until the end of the observation window. The ex-partner’s
body mass index (weight for height measure) falls by 1.5% in the first
three years after separation and diet quality worsens. A possible
interpretation of the results is that living standards fall to the point
where households cannot maintain a minimum level of consumption to meet
their dietary needs, resulting in measurable weight loss.</p>

<h4><strong>The long-run effects of war on health: Evidence from World
War II in France</strong>, <em>Social Science &amp; Medicine</em>
(2021)</h4>
<p>with Olivier Allais &amp; Guy Fagherazzi</p>
<p>We investigate the effects of early-life exposure to war on adult
health outcomes including cancer, hypertension, angina, infarction,
diabetes and obesity. We combine data from the French prospective cohort
study E3N on women employed in the French National Education with
historical data on World War II. To identify causal effects, we exploit
exogenous spatial and temporal variation in war exposure related to the
German invasion of France during the Battle of France. The number of
French military casualties at the level of the postcode area serves as
main measure of exposure. Our results suggest that exposure to the war
during the first 5 years of life has significant adverse effects on
health in adulthood. A 10 percent increase in the number of deaths per
100,000 inhabitants in the individual’s postcode area of birth increases
the probability of suffering from any of the health conditions
considered in this study by 0.08 percentage points. This is relative to
a mean of 49 percent for the sample as a whole.</p>

<h4><strong>Associations between early-life food deprivation during
World War II and risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes at
adulthood</strong>, <em>Scientific Reports</em> (2020)</h4>
<p>with Marie-Christine Boutron-Ruault, Marie-Aline Charles, Olivier
Allais &amp; Guy Fagherazzi</p>
<p>The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) framework
suggests that early-life experiences affect long-term health outcomes.
We tested this hypothesis by estimating the long-run effects of exposure
to World War II-related food deprivation during childhood and
adolescence on the risk of suffering from hypertension and type 2
diabetes at adulthood for 90,226 women from the French prospective
cohort study E3N. We found that the experience of food deprivation
during early-life was associated with a higher risk of developing type 2
diabetes (+0.7%, 95% CI: 0.073–1.37%) and hypertension (+2.6%, 95% CI:
0.81–4.45%). Effects were stronger for individuals exposed at younger
ages. Exposed individuals also achieved lower levels of education, slept
less, and were more frequently smokers than unexposed individuals. These
results are compatible with both the latency and the pathway models
proposed in the DOHaD framework which theorise the association between
early life exposure and adult health through both a direct link and an
indirect link where changes in health determinants mediate health
outcomes.</p>

<h4><strong>Changes in food purchases at retirement in France</strong>,
<em>Food Policy</em> (2020)</h4>
<p>with Olivier Allais &amp; Pascal Leroy</p>
<p>We estimate the impact of retirement on food expenditure and food
quantities purchased, using detailed home-scan panel data on food
purchases and household characteristics in France. We identify a causal
relationship by exploiting the French legal minimum age for retirement
as an exogenous shock to retirement behavior. Upon retirement,
households significantly decrease their expenditure on food and the
amount of food purchased. Households with lower pre-retirement income
appear to be more severely affected. Our results indicate that the
decrease in food quantities purchased at the aggregate level is driven
by a decline in purchases of food from animal origins. A reduced
consumption of animal based food products is likely to undermine the
diet balance of retirees.</p>

<h4><strong>Health outcomes of residential agricultural pesticide
exposure: Causal modelling from observational data (Project
HORAPEST)</strong></h4>
<p>with Olivier Allais, Philippe Caillou, Cyriaque Rousselot, et Florian
Yger</p>
<p>We assess the adverse impact of residential pesticide diffusion on
residents living close to agricultural lands, exposed to pesticides via
spray drift and volatilisation beyond the treated areas. This population
is largely absent in studies to date. We exploit sensitive health data
in combination with newly available data on pesticide pollution. For the
sake of a clear focus, we will rely on the body of knowledge relating
the exposure to some molecules at precise stages of the pregnancy, to
the impaired development of specific cognitive and biological systems.
Accordingly, the study will focus on the short and medium-term pesticide
impact on newborns and children. We use quasi-experimental methods and
new machine learning approaches for causal inference to face the main
challenges of non-linearity of the effects, high dimensionality of the
potential causes (cocktail effect), data incompleteness, and hidden
confounding factors.</p>

<h4><strong>The Cost of Long-Term Cumulative Exposure to Air Pollution:
Quasi-experimental Evidence from France (Project SCCAIR)</strong></h4>
<p>with Emeline Lequy-Flahault, Marion Leroutier, Hélène Ollivier and
Aurélien Saussay</p>
<p>We quantify the long-term societal costs of exposure to ambient air
pollution. Leveraging detailed residential histories, we construct novel
individual-level measures of cumulative exposure to air pollution in
France. We exploit the large-scale shut-down of polluting power plants
that took place in the 1980s, following the transition to nuclear
energy, as a natural experiment to investigate the consequences of
permanent air quality improvements on educational, employment and health
outcomes. This project advances the literature by focusing on cumulative
rather than short-term exposure, examining a broad set of educational,
employment, and health outcomes, and applying quasi-experimental methods
to produce plausibly unbiased estimates of air pollution’s societal
costs.</p>

<h4><strong>Climate Change Resilience through Health Systems: The Role
of Healthcare Access in Shielding Children from Drought-Related
Undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa (Project CLIMRES-SSA)</strong></h4>
<p>with Christoph Strupat, Martin Siegel and Paula von Haaren</p>
<p>This study investigates whether access to healthcare can mitigate the
adverse effects of in-utero exposure to climate shocks—specifically
droughts and floods—on early childhood nutritional outcomes across 34
sub-Saharan African countries. Using geocoded microdata from the
Demographic and Health Surveys (1986–2018), combined with
high-resolution environmental and health systems data, we estimate the
impact of climate stress during gestation on child stunting, wasting,
and underweight. We exploit spatial and temporal variation in climate
conditions and healthcare access—measured by travel time to facilities
and service quality—to identify causal pathways. Results from
interaction models and subgroup analyses offer new insights into the
role of health systems as a climate resilience mechanism, particularly
for vulnerable populations. This is the first multi-country study in
sub-Saharan Africa to jointly analyze climate risk, healthcare access,
and child health in a unified empirical framework, directly informing
global debates on human development under climate change.</p>

<h4><strong>The mid-term and long-term economic costs of floods: a study
of the Ahr valley (Project SOZIAhr)</strong></h4>
<p>with with Hanna Schwank, Svenja Hippel, Jacqueline Lorenzen, Susanne
Bell, Kathrin Hörschelmann</p>
<p>This study examines the medium- and long-term socioeconomic impacts
of the 2021 flood in the Ahr Valley, with a focus on income and wealth
inequalities. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we compare
affected and unaffected households before and after the disaster to
assess whether the flood exacerbated or reduced existing disparities. We
also analyze how individual responses—such as relocation or access to
public aid—and sociodemographic factors like age, gender, and education
influence recovery trajectories. Beyond economic outcomes, the project
investigates how differential exposure and recovery experiences affect
attitudes toward climate adaptation and mitigation policies, perceptions
of fairness, political trust, and social cohesion. By identifying
mechanisms through which disasters shape inequality, the study provides
evidence-based recommendations for equitable and effective
reconstruction policies, aiming to strengthen regional resilience and
inform responses to future extreme weather events.</p>
