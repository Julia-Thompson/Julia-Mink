<h3>The effect of life-cycle events on food consumption and health: what motivates my research</h3>
<p>During the PhD, my objective is to measure the causal impact of at least three life-cycle events (retirement, divorce and early childhood shocks) on diet and health using new data and a range of different econometric methods. Knowledge about the impact of major life-cycle events on food consumption and health is important for the design of public policies addressing overall population health through diet quality.</p>
<p>Investigating <strong>retirement</strong> is relevant in the context of the current aging of the population. The proportion of individuals aged 60 years or older in Europe is projected to increase to 35% by 2050. It has been shown that an adequate nutrition is important to avoid or postpone the onset of certain dietrelated chronic diseases and cognitive decline or conditions such as frailty in older individuals. Policies which improve nutrition and thereby avoid or postpone the onset of chronic diseases and care-dependency may not only increase the well-being of the concerned elderly individuals but they may also help to curb the costs of health service systems which are already under strain. A correct measure of how retirement impacts food consumption and health is useful to orient policy makers in the design and correct targeting of such preventive health policies.</p>
<p>Examining <strong>couple separation</strong> is similarly motivated by the important increase in separations and single-parent families. In France, the share of cohabiting couples who broke their first union before eight years of life together more than doubled from 12% for unions formed between 1970 and 1978 to 29% for those formed between 1997 and 2005. Food consumption is one important vector of family well-being and knowledge about the eects of separation on family food consumption is particularly interesting to policy makers who want to support vulnerable families through improvements in their diet quality. Well targeted policy supporting vulnerable families is likely to avoid costly negative outcomes in future but necessitates information on how and when precisely the family’s needs are affected.</p>
<p>Finally, malnutrition and <strong>poor living conditions in-utero and during early childhood</strong> seem to be important factors in explaining adult health. In the context of the current epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases, knowing more about the impact of early child nutrition on adult health outcomes offers insights into prevention, diagnosis and intervention.</p>

<h4>Changes in diet and nutrient intake at retirement in France</h4>
<p>with Olivier Allais (INRA) and Pascal Leroy (INRA)</p>
<p>We estimate the impact of retirement on both food expenditure and food quantities purchased, using home-scan panel data on household characteristics and food purchases. To identify a causal relationship, we exploit variations in the French legal minimum age for retirement as an exogenous shock to retirement behaviour. We find that food expenditure and quantities purchased drop at the onset of retirement, indicating that households do not simply change their spending behaviour but decrease actual food quantities purchased. The effects are stronger for individuals from modest income households. The variations are heterogeneous across different food product categories. The changes translate on the one hand into decreases in fat, cholesterol, salt and sugar intakes which are likely to impact health positively. On the other hand, lower protein, mineral and vitamin intakes may have potentially important negative health consequences.</p>

<h4>The effects of World War II on late-life health outcomes in France: A combination of E3N-EPIC cohort study and historical data</h4>
<p>with Olivier Allais (INRA), Guy Fagherazzi (Inserm) and Kalina Rajaobelina (Inserm)</p>
<p>We estimate the long-run effects of growing up during World War II (WWII) on adult health behaviour such as smoking, alcohol use and diet and health conditions including overweight, hypertension, diabetes, cancer and mental health. We use data from E3N, a French prospective cohort study in combination with historical data on geographic variation in the intensity of German military occupation, Allied bombing and distribution of military deaths across France. The effects of WWII on adult health are identified using a measure of food deprivation during WWII as declared by the individuals from E3N. In addition, we attempt to exploit the plausibly exogenous spatial variation in the individual’s exposure to WWII from the historical data to identify a causal relation.</p>

<div id="broken-homes-and-empty-pantries-the-impact-of-separation-on-household-food-consumption" class="section level4">
<h4>Broken homes and empty pantries: The impact of separation on household food consumption</h4>
<p>I investigate the impact of couples’ separation on household food consumption, using detailed panel data on household characteristics and food purchases from <em>Kantar Worldpanel</em> for France. I account for unobservable household characteristics by employing a household fixed effects model and trace the changes in consumption over an extended time interval through a dynamic model. Separation reduces (household-size adjusted) food consumption by around 15% in terms of quantities purchased as well as expenditures. I find that the effects are long-lasting and that certain parts of the population, such as women and families with minor children, are particularly affected. The changes in food consumption are heterogeneous across different food categories. Red meat, other meat, fish, oils and condiment, potatoes and alcohol consumption decrease most (over 20%), whereas the consumption of grains, fruits, vegetables, cooked meat and salt products is relatively less affected. Ready meals, sugar products and soft drinks are the least affected, decreasing by less than 10%. The pattern of diet changes differs across different population sub-groups.</p>
